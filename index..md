# Guidong Luo
 I am a *Math-CS* Sophomore. I am familiar with **Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React.js**. 

The first line of codes I typed out is:
`println(“Hello World”)`

I am looking to try archery and kendo this quarter and explore other new hobbies. I also want to meet more new friends and hang out outside this year.

In this class, I want to:
- learn new technologies 
- practice my front-end development skills
- get to know people interested in software development
- add project to my resume 

If you want to know more about me, this is a link to my [personal website](https://greyluo-profile.web.app/).



Please check out [README](README.md) for more info.
